# CSE515-Project
Introduction:

This is the Phase 2 repo for Multimedia and Web Databases. At its core, the project seeks to extract underlying latent semantics from a database of images, by employing various dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NNMF), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), k-means clustering, and CP Decomposition.Those reduced dimensional vectors are used to see the relevant images and labels.
